# JustGo Storybook 📚

## What is this project? 🤔

**JustGo Storybook** is like a **digital catalog** or **showroom** for website components (the building blocks that make up websites). Think of it as a **LEGO instruction manual** - but instead of showing you how to build with plastic blocks, it shows you how to build beautiful, consistent web interfaces.

### Simple Analogy

Imagine you're building a house. Instead of having each builder use different types of bricks, windows, and doors (which would make the house look inconsistent), you create a **catalog** that shows exactly what materials to use and how they should look. That's what this project does for websites!

---

## Why does this project exist? 🎯

### The Problem

When different developers work on the same website, they might:

- Use different colors for buttons
- Make text sizes inconsistent
- Create components that look different across pages
- Waste time recreating things that already exist

### The Solution

JustGo Storybook solves this by:

- **📖 Creating a single source of truth** - Everyone uses the same components
- **🎨 Maintaining visual consistency** - All buttons, forms, and layouts look the same
- **⚡ Speeding up development** - Developers don't reinvent the wheel
- **🔄 Keeping everything in sync** - When designers change something, it updates everywhere

---

## What technologies are used? 🛠️

Don't worry if these terms are unfamiliar - here's what each one does:

### **Storybook**

- **What it is**: A tool that creates an interactive catalog of website components
- **Why it's useful**: Developers and designers can see and test each component without building the entire website
- **Real-world analogy**: Like a car showroom where you can see each model without visiting every dealership

### **Style Dictionary**

- **What it is**: A system that converts design decisions (colors, fonts, spacing) into code
- **Why it's useful**: When a designer says "use blue #007BFF", it automatically becomes available to all developers
- **Real-world analogy**: Like a paint color chart that ensures everyone uses the exact same shade of blue

### **CSS Variables**

- **What it is**: A way to store design values (like colors and sizes) that can be reused throughout the website
- **Why it's useful**: Change one value, and it updates everywhere it's used
- **Real-world analogy**: Like having a master switch that controls all the lights in your house

### **Git Submodules**

- **What it is**: A way to include one project inside another project
- **Why it's useful**: The design tokens (colors, fonts, etc.) are stored separately and can be shared across multiple projects
- **Real-world analogy**: Like having a shared ingredient list that multiple chefs can use for their recipes

## The Design Token System Explained 🎨

### What are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are like a **digital brand guide** that contains all the design decisions:

**Colors:**

```json
{
  "primary": "#007BFF",
  "secondary": "#6C757D",
  "success": "#28A745"
}
```

**Typography:**

```json
{
  "heading": "24px",
  "body": "16px",
  "small": "14px"
}
```

**Spacing:**

```json
{
  "small": "8px",
  "medium": "16px",
  "large": "32px"
}
```

### Advanced Style Dictionary Features 🚀

#### **Multi-Theme Support (Light & Dark Mode)**

Style Dictionary can generate tokens for different themes automatically:

**Light Theme:**

```json
{
  "theme": "light",
  "color": {
    "background": "#FFFFFF",
    "text": "#212529",
    "surface": "#F8F9FA"
  }
}
```

**Dark Theme:**

```json
{
  "theme": "dark",
  "color": {
    "background": "#212529",
    "text": "#FFFFFF",
    "surface": "#343A40"
  }
}
```

**How it works:**

- One command generates CSS for both light and dark themes
- Automatic CSS custom properties like `--color-background-light` and `--color-background-dark`
- Components can switch themes instantly using CSS classes or JavaScript

#### **Multiple Brand Support** 🏢

Perfect for companies with multiple product lines or white-label solutions:

**Brand A (JustGo):**

```json
{
  "brand": "justgo",
  "color": {
    "primary": "#007BFF",
    "logo": "#0056B3"
  }
}
```

**Brand B (Partner Company):**

```json
{
  "brand": "partner",
  "color": {
    "primary": "#DC3545",
    "logo": "#C82333"
  }
}
```

**Real-world benefits:**

- Same components, different brand colors
- Maintain separate brand identities
- Share development costs across brands
- Quick brand switching for demos

#### **Multi-Platform Output** 📱💻🖥️

Style Dictionary can generate tokens for different platforms and technologies:

| Platform         | Output Format     | Use Case                |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Web**          | CSS Variables     | Websites, web apps      |
| **iOS**          | Swift/Objective-C | iPhone/iPad apps        |
| **Android**      | XML/Kotlin        | Android mobile apps     |
| **React Native** | JavaScript        | Cross-platform mobile   |
| **Flutter**      | Dart              | Cross-platform mobile   |
| **Figma**        | JSON              | Design tool integration |
| **Sketch**       | JSON              | Design tool integration |

**Example multi-platform token:**

```json
{
  "color": {
    "primary": {
      "value": "#007BFF",
      "platforms": {
        "web": "var(--color-primary)",
        "ios": "UIColor.systemBlue",
        "android": "@color/primary",
        "flutter": "Color(0xFF007BFF)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### How it Works (The Magic Behind the Scenes)

1. **Designers create tokens** with theme, brand, and platform specifications
2. **Developers run** `npm run build:tokens`
3. **Style Dictionary processes** tokens based on configuration rules
4. **Multiple output files generated:**
   - `variables-light.css` and `variables-dark.css`
   - `brand-justgo.css` and `brand-partner.css`
   - `tokens.ios.swift` and `tokens.android.xml`
5. **Each platform/theme/brand** uses appropriate token files
6. **Everything stays synchronized** across all variants

### Configuration Example 🔧

```javascript
// style-dictionary.config.js
module.exports = {
  source: ["tokens/**/*.json"],
  platforms: {
    // Web CSS - Light Theme
    "web/css/light": {
      transformGroup: "css",
      buildPath: "build/css/",
      files: [
        {
          destination: "variables-light.css",
          format: "css/variables",
          filter: (token) => token.theme === "light",
        },
      ],
    },
    // Web CSS - Dark Theme
    "web/css/dark": {
      transformGroup: "css",
      buildPath: "build/css/",
      files: [
        {
          destination: "variables-dark.css",
          format: "css/variables",
          filter: (token) => token.theme === "dark",
        },
      ],
    },
    // iOS Swift
    ios: {
      transformGroup: "ios",
      buildPath: "build/ios/",
      files: [
        {
          destination: "StyleTokens.swift",
          format: "ios/colors.swift",
        },
      ],
    },
    // Android XML
    android: {
      transformGroup: "android",
      buildPath: "build/android/",
      files: [
        {
          destination: "colors.xml",
          format: "android/colors",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};
```
